# Structure
All sub-directories contain readme files designed for specific tasks, hardwares' being more of a rationales and softwares' more of an instructions. The most detailed readme I create is for [SW2](https://github.com/Challmymind/SpaceTasks2024/tree/main/SW2).

# Altium
I've never used Altium before, so I wasn't sure which files to export, so I exported everything. The history could probably be deleted, but I wanted to avoid confusion so I just kept it.
I found Altium very useful, especially when doing polygons, much better experience than Kicad. The manufacturer's parts search is also an amazing tool that I never thought would be so useful.

# STM32CubeIDE
All software projects use the STM32CubeIDE build, [one of them](https://github.com/Challmymind/SpaceTasks2024/tree/main/SW2) has added custom pre-build step that is documented in the readme under the trick section.

# Possible improvements
Most readmes have a short section where I use 2-3 sentences to point out what could be improved if further development were done.
